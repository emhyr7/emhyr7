hello, my preferred name is Emhyr /iːˈmɪər/. i'm 17, and like systems programming (aspiring towards games programming).

i've been programming alone (no mentors; just sheer will of interest) since ~maybe~ 2021? i'm proficient in C, used to program in C++ (but it got tiring), and can program in Odin and Rust (given the internet).

currently, i'm building a compiler that uses a state-translation table, automatic precedence parser, and generates the AST as an array of pointer-less nodes; a memory allocation library that exploits virtual memory for—but not soley for—O(1) dynamic array appending _always_, and safety features; and a bit manipulation lirbary.

the only job experience i have is as a hostess. i unfortunately don't have any cool experiences (e.g. internships, honorary education) related to programming due to personal factors. however, this does allow me to pursue my interests, and when you pursue your interests, you _pursue_ them.
